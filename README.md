# Sentence-Transformer-Implementation
A Sentence Transformer implementation using sBERT's sentence_transformers and Huggingface's transformers library

This repository contains one notebook that could be run from start to finish, without issue. 

I included a training loop for "sentiment analysis/sentence classification", which will require the use of a GPU on a Google Colab notebook environment.

No training loop was developed or provided for the "named entity recognition" task due to time constraints. A pretrained model, however, was successfully loaded and was able to do a forward pass with satisfactory results.

To show how a GPU may be selected, I've included the below two screenshots.
